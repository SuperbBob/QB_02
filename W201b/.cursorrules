# W201b Personal Accounting Assistant

## Project Overview
Develop a React-based personal accounting assistant with the following features:
- 快速记账 (Quick Expense Entry): Fast and intuitive expense recording
- 数据可视化 (Data Visualization): Charts and graphs for financial insights
- 预算提醒 (Budget Reminders): Alert system for budget tracking

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React (latest stable version)
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Library**: Consider using modern UI libraries (e.g., Ant Design, Material-UI, or shadcn/ui)
- **Charts**: Use a library like Recharts or Chart.js for data visualization
- **State Management**: React Context API or Zustand for state management
- **Routing**: React Router if multiple pages are needed
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices and conventions
- Implement proper TypeScript types for all props and state
- Use meaningful component and variable names (both English and Chinese if needed)
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility principle)

### Component Structure
- Organize components in a modular structure
- Create reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- Separate business logic from presentation components
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

### Key Features Implementation

#### 1. Quick Expense Entry (快速记账)
- Simple form with date, category, amount, and description fields
- Provide quick category buttons or dropdown
- Support for both income and expense tracking
- Local storage for persistence

#### 2. Data Visualization (数据可视化)
- Expense breakdown by category (pie chart)
- Daily/weekly/monthly trends (line or bar chart)
- Income vs Expense comparison
- Interactive charts with tooltips and legends

#### 3. Budget Reminders (预算提醒)
- Set budget limits for different categories or total spending
- Visual indicators when approaching limits
- Notifications or alerts when budget is exceeded
- Budget vs Actual comparison chart

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  type: 'income' | 'expense';
  category: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface Budget {
  category: string;
  limit: number;
  period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';
}
```

### Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement lazy loading if needed
- Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Consider using useMemo and useCallback for performance-critical code

### Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

### Testing (Optional)
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test critical user flows
- Consider using React Testing Library

## Localization (if needed)
- Support both English and Chinese interfaces
- Use i18n library if multi-language support is required

## Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile-responsive design

## Responsive Design 

### Mobile-First Approach
- Design with mobile devices as the primary target
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
- Implement breakpoints: mobile (< 768px), tablet (768px - 1024px), desktop (> 1024px)
- Test on actual devices or use browser DevTools for responsive testing

### Touch-Friendly Interface
- Minimum touch target size: 44px x 44px for buttons and interactive elements
- Increase spacing between clickable elements to prevent accidental taps
- Use swipe gestures where appropriate (e.g., swipe to delete transactions)
- Implement pull-to-refresh functionality

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations
- Optimize charts for small screens (simplified legends, horizontal scrolling if needed)
- Use bottom navigation or fixed action button for quick access to main actions
- Implement collapsible sections to save vertical space
- Use modals or drawers instead of new pages for secondary actions

### Responsive Typography
- Use relative units (rem, em) for font sizes
- Ensure text remains readable on small screens (minimum 14px for body text)
- Use appropriate line heights for mobile reading (1.5-1.6)

### Chart Adaptations
- Make charts scrollable horizontally on mobile if necessary
- Simplify chart legends and labels on small screens
- Consider using tab-based or accordion layouts for multiple charts
- Touch-optimized tooltips and interactive elements

## User Experience

### Intuitive Navigation
- Clear and consistent navigation structure
- Breadcrumbs or back buttons where appropriate
- Quick access to frequently used features
- Minimize the number of clicks to complete tasks

### Visual Feedback
- Immediate feedback for user actions (button states, loading indicators)
- Success/error messages for operations
- Smooth animations and transitions (use CSS transitions or libraries like Framer Motion)
- Hover states and active states for interactive elements

### Form Design
- Large input fields for easy data entry on mobile
- Use appropriate input types (number, date, email, etc.)
- Inline validation with clear error messages
- Auto-focus on first input when appropriate
- Keyboard-friendly (numeric keyboard for amounts)

### Loading States
- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Disable interactive elements during operations to prevent duplicate submissions

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages in Chinese and English
- Graceful degradation when features fail
- Provide clear recovery options
- Log errors for debugging (console or error tracking service)

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images (WebP format, lazy loading)
- Minimize initial bundle size
- Code splitting for routes
- Debounce search and filter inputs
- Virtual scrolling for long lists

### Accessibility Features
- Proper semantic HTML (header, nav, main, footer)
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management (skip links, focus traps in modals)
- High contrast mode support
- Disable animations for users who prefer reduced motion (respect prefers-reduced-motion)

### Data Persistence
- Auto-save draft entries
- Confirm before deleting important data
- Clear "no data" states with helpful messages
- Export functionality (CSV, PDF) for backups

### Personalization
- Remember user preferences (theme, default categories)
- Customizable categories
- Option to set default currency
- Dark mode support (prefers-color-scheme)

## Notes
- Focus on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface
- Ensure the app is easy to use and navigate
- Implement proper error handling
- Add loading states for better UX
